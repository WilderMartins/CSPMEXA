# General Settings (rarely changed from defaults in config.py)
# PROJECT_NAME="PolicyEngineService"
# API_V1_STR="/api/v1"

# Add any specific configurations for the policy engine here if needed in the future.
# For example, connection details if it needs to fetch policies from a database,
# or configuration for different compliance standards.
# For now, it's stateless and configured by its code.
