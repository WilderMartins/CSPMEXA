# These are used by Boto3 to interact with AWS.
# If running locally (not in EC2 with an instance profile), you might need to provide credentials.
# It's often better to configure these via shared AWS credentials files (~/.aws/credentials)
# or environment variables that Boto3 automatically picks up (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN).

# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" # Optional: if not using other auth methods
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" # Optional: if not using other auth methods

# General Settings (rarely changed from defaults in config.py)
