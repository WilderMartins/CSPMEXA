Generic single-database configuration.

This directory created by Alembic is where database migration scripts
are stored.  See the Alembic tutorial at http://alembic.sqlalchemy.org
for more information.

Within the ``versions/`` subdirectory, each file is known as a "revision",
and represents a series of steps to upgrade or downgrade a database -
these files are historical, meaning, they are each processed in order
to represent a particular version of the database.

The file ``env.py`` is a Python script that is run whenever the ``alembic``
command-line tool is invoked.   It provides a programmatic interface
to the migration process, including the ability to read from a ``.ini``
file as well as to set up the Python logging configuration.  Most importantly,
it is the script that actually defines how migrations are to be run,
providing a ``context`` object to revision scripts that provides the
directives that actually issue SQL to the database.

The file ``script.py.mako`` is a Mako template file which is used
to generate new revision files.  Adjust this template to suit
the needs of new revision files.

When the ``alembic`` command-line tool is run, it first looks for an
``alembic.ini`` file in the current directory.  This file is optional
in modern versions of Alembic, as the ``-c`` option can be passed to
the ``alembic`` command line tool.  However, it's convenient to have it
present.

The ``alembic.ini`` file normally refers to the ``env.py`` script,
which in turn refers to the ``script.py.mako`` template, and it also
contains the ``sqlalchemy.url`` configuration item which points to the
target database.
